# Launching Collaborate

### **Using Heroku and Google Cloud**

Important: Using a service like Google Cloud and Heroku requires some technical knowledge, and while the service has a free tier, you may incur charges when using it. Youâ€™ll be responsible for paying for, maintaining and backing up your own Collaborate instance. ProPublica will not have access to it \(or even know that it exists\). Shutting your instance down may cause you to lose data. You should make sure you understand how to use this or any cloud service before relying on it.
