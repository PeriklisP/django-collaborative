# Contact Log

For crowdsourced projects, you can keep track of each time a reporter reaches out to the source. Enter the reporter name and select a contact method. Click “Today” for today's date, or select a date by clicking on the calendar icon. Click “Now” for time, or select a time by clicking the clock. Then scroll down and hit “Save.” Each contact will now be saved in a log on that individual entry.
