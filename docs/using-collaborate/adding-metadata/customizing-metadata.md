# Customizing Metadata

If you have a developer, you can change the names of metadata fields, including the "Status" dropdown box, the "Assigned to" field, the "Notes" field and the contact log. You can also add new sections of metadata. This will allow you to make metadata fields specific to your project and your organizational needs. Ask your developer to [follow these instructions on Github](https://github.com/propublica/django-collaborative/blob/master/docs/examples/updating_metadata_schema.py).
