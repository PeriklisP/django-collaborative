# How to Upload Your Data

Collaborate allows you to work with spreadsheets in CSV format and in Google Sheets, and with forms created through Google Forms and Screendoor.

Note: Launching with Heroku will allow Google Sheets, Screendoor and Google Forms to automatically update and show changes to your original dataset in Collaborate. If you launch Collaborate using Google Cloud Run, it does not automatically configure scheduled reimporting, but you can add it via Cloud Scheduler by [following these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/events/using-scheduler).
